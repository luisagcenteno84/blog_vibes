### **Product Requirements Document: Luis Gonzalez Blog**

**1. Introduction & Vision**

This document outlines the requirements for the **Luis Gonzalez Blog**. The core vision is to create a lightweight, secure, and performant blog application written entirely in Python. The platform will be designed for easy content management by the author and a clean, accessible reading experience for visitors. A key feature will be an integrated AI chatbot to assist the author with brainstorming and content creation. The entire system will be architected for seamless deployment and operation on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

**2. Target Audience**

*   **Primary User (Author):** Luis Gonzalez. You need a simple and secure way to write, edit, publish, and manage articles, as well as a creative tool to help generate ideas.
*   **Secondary User (Reader):** Visitors to your blog. They need an easy-to-navigate site to read articles, search for content, and potentially leave comments.

**3. Functional Requirements**

**3.1. Author-Facing Features (Admin Panel)**

*   **Secure Authentication:**
    *   Author must log in with a username and password to access the admin panel.
    *   A secure password reset mechanism should be available.
*   **Post Management (CRUD):**
    *   **Create:** Write new posts using a simple, web-based editor that supports Markdown for formatting.
    *   **Read:** View a list of all posts (both published and drafts) in a dashboard.
    *   **Update:** Edit existing posts.
    *   **Delete:** Permanently remove posts.
*   **Post States:**
    *   **Draft:** Posts can be saved as drafts and are not visible to the public.
    *   **Published:** Posts are live and visible to all readers.
*   **Content Organization:**
    *   Posts can be assigned one or more tags or categories for organization.
*   **AI-Powered Idea Generation (Chatbot):**
    *   An integrated chatbot interface within the admin panel, available only to the logged-in author.
    *   The author can interact with the chatbot to brainstorm post ideas, generate titles, create outlines, or get help drafting content.
    *   The chatbot will be powered by the Google Gemini API.

**3.2. Reader-Facing Features (Public Website)**

*   **Homepage:**
    *   Displays a paginated list of the most recent published posts in reverse chronological order.
    *   Each entry should show the post title, publication date, a brief summary/excerpt, and a "Read More" link.
*   **Post Page:**
    *   A unique URL for each post (e.g., `luisgonzalez.blog/posts/my-first-post`).
    *   Displays the full content of the post, including the title, author, and publication date.
*   **Navigation & Discovery:**
    *   Readers can browse posts by tag/category.
    *   A search bar to find posts based on keywords in the title or body.
    *   An archive page to view posts by month and year.
*   **RSS Feed:**
    *   An automatically generated RSS feed so readers can subscribe to your blog.

**4. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **Performance:** The website should load quickly for users. Page load times should aim to be under 2 seconds.
*   **Security:** All user inputs must be sanitized. Passwords must be securely hashed. API keys and other secrets must be stored securely and not in the codebase.
*   **Technology Stack:** The backend and frontend rendering must be handled by a Python framework.
*   **Scalability:** The application should be stateless where possible to allow for horizontal scaling on GCP.
*   **Maintainability:** The code should be well-organized, commented where necessary, and adhere to Python's PEP 8 style guide.

**5. Proposed Technical Stack & Architecture**

*   **Web Framework:** **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
*   **Database:** **PostgreSQL** (managed by **Google Cloud SQL**).
*   **ORM:** **SQLAlchemy**.
*   **Frontend Rendering:** **Jinja2 Templates**.
*   **CSS Framework:** **Bootstrap** or **Tailwind CSS**.
*   **AI Integration:** **Google AI Python SDK** (`google-generativeai`) to communicate with the Gemini API.

**6. Deployment Strategy on Google Cloud**

*   **Containerization:** The application will be packaged into a **Docker** container.
*   **Hosting:** **Google Cloud Run**.
*   **Database:** **Google Cloud SQL** for PostgreSQL.
*   **Secrets Management:** The Gemini API key and database credentials will be stored in **Google Secret Manager** and securely accessed by the Cloud Run service at runtime.
*   **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Deployment):**
    *   Set up **Google Cloud Build** to automatically build the Docker image and deploy it to Cloud Run whenever you push changes to your Git repository.
